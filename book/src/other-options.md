# Other options

Some other options accepted by `cargo nextest run`:

* `--no-fail-fast`: do not exit the test run on the first failure. Most useful for CI scenarios.
* `-j, --test-threads`: number of tests to run simultaneously. Note that this is separate from the number of build jobs to run simultaneously, which is specified by `--build-jobs`.
* `--run-ignored ignored-only` runs ignored tests, while `--run-ignored all` runs both ignored and non-ignored tests.
* `--failure-output` and `--success-output` control when standard output and standard error are displayed for failing and passing tests, respectively. The possible values are:
  * `immediate`: display output as soon as the test fails. Default for `--failure-output`.
  * `final`: display output at the end of the test run.
  * `immediate-final`: display output as soon as the test fails, and at the end of the run. This is most useful for CI runs.
  * `never`: never display output. Default for `--success-output`.
* `--status-level`: which test statuses (**PASS**, **FAIL** etc) to display. There are 7 status levels: `none, fail, retry, slow, pass, skip, all`. Each status level causes all earlier status levels to be displayed as well. (For example, setting `status-level` to `skip` will show failing, retried, slow and passing tests along with skipped tests.) The default is `pass`.
