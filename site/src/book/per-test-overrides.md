# Per-test overrides

Nextest supports overriding some settings for subsets of tests, using the [filter
expression](filter-expressions.md) syntax.

Overrides are set via the `[[profile.<name>.overrides]]` list. Each override consists of the following:
* `filter` — The filter expression to match.
* Supported overrides, which are optional. Currently supported are:
  * `retries` — Number of retries to run tests with.

## Example

```toml
[profile.ci]
retries = 1

[[profile.ci.overrides]]
filter = 'test(/\Wtest_network_/)'
retries = 4
```

This configuration will retry all test names that start with `test_network_` (including test names
like `::test_network_`) up to 4 times. Other tests will be retried up to one time.

## Override precedence

Overrides are applied in the following order. For a given test T:
1. If nextest is run with `--profile my-profile`, the first override within `profile.my-profile.overrides` that matches T.
2. The first override within `profile.default.overrides` that matches T.
3. If nextest is run with `--profile my-profile`, the global configuration for that profile.
4. The global configuration specified by `profile.default`.

### Example

```toml
[profile.default]
retries = 0  # this is the default, so it doesn't need to be specified

[[profile.default.overrides]]
filter = 'package(my-package)'
retries = 2

[profile.ci]
retries = 1

[[profile.ci.overrides]]
filter = 'package(my-package) and test(/^flaky::/)'
retries = 3
```

If nextest is run with `--profile ci`:
* Tests in `my-package` that begin with `flaky::` are retried 3 times.
* Other tests in `my-package` are retried 2 times.
* All other tests are retried up to one time.

If nextest is run without `--profile`:
* Tests in `my-package` are retried 2 times.
* Other tests are retried 0 times.
