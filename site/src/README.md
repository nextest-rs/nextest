# cargo-nextest

Welcome to the home page for cargo-nextest, a next-generation test runner for Rust projects.

## Features

<img src="static/cover.png" style="float: right; width: 250px">

* **Clean, beautiful user interface.** nextest presents its results concisely so you can see which tests passed and failed at a glance.
* **[Up to 60% faster](book/benchmarks.md) than cargo test.** Nextest uses a [state-of-the-art execution model](book/how-it-works.md) for faster, more reliable test runs.
* **Detect flaky tests.** Nextest can [automatically retry](book/retries.md) failing tests for you, and if they pass later nextest will mark them as flaky.
* **Partition test runs across several CI jobs.** If your tests take too long to run in CI, nextest can automatically split them up for you across several jobs.
* **Cross-platform.** nextest works on Unix, Mac and Windows, so you get the benefits of faster test runs no matter what platform you use.
* ... and more [coming soon](https://github.com/nextest-rs/nextest/projects/1)!
