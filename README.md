## Minimum supported Rust version

The minimum supported Rust version to *run* nextest with is **Rust 1.38.** Nextest is not tested against versions that are that old, but it should work with any version of Rust released in the past year. (Please report a bug if not!)

The minimum supported Rust version to *build* nextest with is **Rust 1.73.** For building, at least the last 3 versions of stable Rust are supported at any given time.

See the [stability policy](https://nexte.st/book/stability) for more details.

While a crate is pre-release status (0.x.x) it may have its MSRV bumped in a patch release. Once a
crate has reached 1.x, any MSRV bump will be accompanied with a new minor version.
