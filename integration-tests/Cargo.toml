# We specify default-no-update here because if users just run:
#
# cargo build --no-default-features --features default-no-update
#
# then cargo will unify features for cargo-nextest, and it will be built with self-update enabled.
# We could ask distributors to always include `--package cargo-nextest` instead, but they're likely
# to forget. None of our current tests depend on self-update, so just don't include it by default.
