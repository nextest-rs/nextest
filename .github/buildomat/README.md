# Buildomat CI

We use Oxide Computer's [Buildomat](https://github.com/oxidecomputer/buildomat) for some of our CI jobs.

Currently, the only Buildomat job is a build and test run on [illumos](https://illumos.org/), but in the future some of nextest's Linux jobs may use Buildomat as well.

Compute resources for Buildomat are provided by Oxide Computer (which is where nextest's main author currently works).
