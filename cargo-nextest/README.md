cargo-nextest is a next-generation test runner for Rust.

For documentation and usage, see [the nextest site](https://nexte.st).

## Installation

To install nextest binaries (quicker), see [_Pre-built
binaries_](https://nexte.st/docs/installation/pre-built-binaries).

To install from source, run:

```sh
cargo install --locked cargo-nextest
```

**The `--locked` flag is required.** Builds without `--locked` are not
guaranteed to work.

## Minimum supported Rust versions

Nextest has two minimum supported Rust versions (MSRVs): one for _building_
nextest itself, and one for _running tests_ with `cargo nextest run`.

For more information about the MSRVs and the stability policy around them,
see [_Minimum supported Rust
versions_](https://nexte.st/docs/stability/#minimum-supported-rust-versions)
on the nextest site.
