# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Changed

- MSRV bumped to Rust 1.56.

## [0.4.0] - 2022-03-07

Thanks to [Guiguiprim](https://github.com/Guiguiprim) for their contributions to this release!

### Added

- Filter test binaries by the build platform they're for (target or host).
- Experimental support for reusing build artifacts between the build and run steps.
- Nextest executions done as a separate process per test (currently the only supported method, though this might change in the future) set the environment variable `NEXTEST_PROCESS_MODE=process-per-test`.

### Changed

- `TargetRunner` now has separate handling for the target and host platforms. As part of this, a new struct `PlatformRunner` represents a target runner for a single platform.

## [0.3.0] - 2022-02-23

### Fixed

- Target runners of the form `runner = ["bin-name", "--arg1", ...]` are now parsed correctly ([#75]).
- Binary IDs for `[[bin]]` and `[[example]]` tests are now unique, in the format `<crate-name>::bin/<binary-name>` and `<crate-name>::test/<binary-name>` respectively ([#76]).
