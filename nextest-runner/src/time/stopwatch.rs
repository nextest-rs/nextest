//! Stopwatch for tracking how long it takes to run tests.
//!
//! Tests need to track a start time and a duration. For that we use a combination of a `SystemTime`
//! (realtime clock) and an `Instant` (monotonic clock). Once the stopwatch transitions to the "end"
//! state, we can report the elapsed time using the monotonic clock.
