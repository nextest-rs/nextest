## [0.4.0] - 2023-05-15

### Changed

- `FilteringExpr` now carries three forms of an expression:
  - `input`, which is the raw input as provided.
  - `parsed`, which represents a parsed expression that hasn't yet been evaluated against a specific
    `PackageGraph`. This is a newly public type `ParsedExpr`.
  - `compiled`, which is an expression that has been compiled against a `PackageGraph`. This is of
    type `CompiledExpr`, which is what `FilteringExpr` used to be.
- Newlines are now supported within expressions, for e.g. multiline TOML for nextest's overrides.
- A clean, well-formatted representation of a parsed expression can now be generated via the
  `Display` impl on `ParsedExpr`.
- The parser has been extensively fuzzed. No bugs were found.
- MSRV updated to Rust 1.66.

## [0.3.0] - 2022-11-23

## [0.2.2] - 2022-10-14

### Internal

- Updated private dependency [recursion](https://crates.io/crates/recursion) to 0.3.0. Thanks [Inanna](https://github.com/inanna-malick) for your contribution!

## [0.2.1] - 2022-07-30

### Internal

- Evaluation now uses a stack machine via the [recursion](https://crates.io/crates/recursion) crate. Thanks [Inanna](https://github.com/inanna-malick) for your first contribution!

## [0.2.0] - 2022-07-13

### Added

- The expression language supports several new [predicates](https://nexte.st/book/filter-expressions#basic-predicates):
  - `kind(name-matcher)`: include all tests in binary kinds (e.g. `lib`, `test`, `bench`) matching `name-matcher`.
  - `binary(name-matcher)`: include all tests in binary names matching `name-matcher`.
  - `platform(host)` or `platform(target)`: include all tests that are [built for the host or target platform](running.md#filtering-by-build-platform), respectively.

* It is now possible to evaluate a query without knowing the name of the test. The result is evaluated as a [three-valued logic (Kleene K3)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-valued_logic#Kleene_and_Priest_logics), and is returned as an `Option<bool>` where `None` indicates the unknown state.

### Changed

- The evaluator now takes a `TestQuery` struct, making it easier to add more parameters in the future.
- MSRV updated to Rust 1.59.
